# Virtual Pet

Think of your fondest childhood memories and you may immediately think of how much fun you had when you played with your tamagotchi and digimon.  What if I was to say you could continue playing with a virtual pet...even now as an adult!? 

Introducing the newest interactive game where you get to hang out and play with your favorite virtual buddy, Larry the Lizard.  Watch as you can feed him, give him water, and even play with him! Make sure you take good care of him and are constantly looking out for his vital bodily functions as with each turn, his hunger, thirst, and tiredness levels increase and if you get to level 60 of any function, he takes off and runs to another home! 

The programming behind this application is that Larry the Lizard starts at random levels for his 4 major bodily functions: hunger, thirst, playfulness, and sleep.  You give a user input for each of the 4 activities: feeding him, giving him water, playing with him, and letting him go to sleep that affects each level of bodily function.  With each turn, each bodily function will automatically increase 1 level and if any of the levels reaches 60, the game is over.    

Play with Larry the Lizard and let him be your new favorite roommate!  Who says you're too old to have virtual pets?
